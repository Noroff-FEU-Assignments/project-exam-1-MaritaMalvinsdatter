## Description

This was our Exam Project where we had to make a blog of our choosing, and put into practice the skills we had learned during our first year of studies. I chose a travel blog.
The project had two main aspect; making a call to the WordPress REST API to fetch the data we had made on the back-end, and building the site with HTML, CSS and JS.

We needed to make at least 5 pages, write the code with semantic and neatly indented HTML, follow the DRY principles for the CSS, and make it dynamic with JS.
The site also need to be responive, attracive and easy to use across all screen sizes.
